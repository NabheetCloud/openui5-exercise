# OpenUI5 Training
This repo will contain a step-by-step training course that I've created for new OpenUI5 developers that are joining our [Techedge Group](http://www.techedgegroup.com) office in Lucca (Italy).

Training will be divided in step from easy to hard to build a complete CRUD SAPUI5 Master-Detail application.
The project will consume/create data of an SAP OData service from [Netweaver Gateway Demo ES5](https://blogs.sap.com/2017/06/16/netweaver-gateway-demo-es5-now-in-beta/). 
The IDE used in this topic is the SAP WebIDE that allow us to leverage the power of SAP SCP (Cloud Platform) to develop, configure, build and deploy on SAP Cloud Environment in a matter of seconds.

You can find each step of the exercise (with a description and a video of the final result) in a separate branch of this GitHub repository.

## Topics

 - XML views and fragments
 - Routing
 - Filter and Sort
 - OData model (configuring an SCP Destination)
 - JSONModel
 - Understanding manifest.json
 - Table and List
 - Master-Detail layout
 - SAP WebIDE
 - SAP Fiori Launch
 - Tip & Tricks

## Where to start

As I said this exercise will be based on an OData service provided through the SAP Netweaver Gateway Demo. You have to create a user on the demo system in order to access to those informations.

###  Configure SCP Cockpit Destination used 
Login into your SAP SCP account. Go inside *Connectivity > Destinations* and create a *New Destination* with the information provided in the blog post of the Gateway Demo System.
I've already prepared the configuration for (lazy one!) so you can just click on the *Import Destination* button. Just remember to configure your User/Password and test it before hitting Save.

**Tip:** I would suggest you to call the destination on your SAP SCP cockpit the same way I've used. In this way when you clone the Exercise Step from the repo's branch there will be no naming conflict

### Create a WebIDE Project from Template

Ok, it's time to develop. Now I will show you how you can create a WebIDE project. We're in an advanced exercise so I hope you already know how to do it but maybe it could be useful also for newcomers ;)

Follow the help video: [Create a new SAPUI5 app on SAP WebIDE Full-Stack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymopVPlTTuw)

### Configure the OData service with the ES5 Destination

Now we need to create a Destination from our SAP SCP account to our OData Service.
Follow the help video: [Configure OData Service on your SAPUI5 Application](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SXlugW-QNc)

##  Step 1

### What will be covered on this exercise

-   What is an XML Metadata Manifest and what’s inside it?
-   How to use our OData Model and bind it into our application
-   Use a  `sap.m.Table`  with items and property binding
-   Use  `sap.ui.model.type.DateTime`  to format JavaScript Date

##  Step 2

### What will be covered on this exercise

With Part 2 of this series of blog posts, we will learn how to interact with data in our Tables and List. We will learn how to filter and sort data in a smart way.

-   Create  [JSONModel](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.json.JSONModel)  to handle local data
-   Set a default sizeLimit to our JSONModel
-   [FilterBar](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.ui.comp.filterbar.FilterBar): UI control that displays filters in a user-friendly manner to populate values for a query
-   Use XML Fragments to create a View Settings Dialog to handle sort and group data
-   [Filter](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.Filter)  and  [Sort](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.Sorter)  data
-   Add an Info Toolbar to our table to display useful information

##  Step 3

### What will be covered on this exercise

With Part 3 of this series of blog posts, we will learn how to create a Master-Detail application leveraging the SplitApp UI control and how correctly configure the app’s manifest to handle routes and targets.

-   [SplitApp](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.m.SplitApp): UI control that allows you to create a Master-Detail application (used as a replacement of the App control)
-   [Routing](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/topic/e5200ee755f344c8aef8efcbab3308fb): we will configure the manifest.json to correctly handle the routing of the application
-   [ObjectHeader](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.m.ObjectHeader): control that enables the user to easily identify a specific object. The object header title is the key identifier of the object and additional text and icons can be used to further distinguish it from other objects
-   Navigation to a detail view and bind the element context: you will learn how to navigate and open a detail page and bind the current View (of the detail) to a new context
-   [List](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.m.List): in the master page we will use a list to display BusinessPartner because we will have less space

##  Step 4


### What will be covered on this exercise

With Part 4 of this series of blog posts, we will learn how to create a second drill-down page with information about the Sale Order detail and display a table of Sale Order items.

The most important part of this exercise is to understand how to Delete (part of the CRUD operations) a Sale Order Item of a Sale Order.

-   [ODataModel](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel): we have already used it to display server-side information about our Business Partner, Order Sale. Now we’re going to use it to display Sale Order Item and delete them from the set. For this purpose, we’re going to use the  [remove](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel/methods/remove)  method

This is our main task in this exercise but it’s not the only thing we’ve done in the code

##  Step 5


### What will be covered on this exercise


With Part 5 of this series of blog posts, we will learn how to create a SimpleForm within a Dialog that will allow us to update the information of a Sales Order Item.

Before updating the database order we have to check that everything typed by the user validates our constraints.

-   [ODataModel](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel): we have already used it to display server-side information about our Business Partner, Sales Order, and Sales Order Items. We’ve also used it to delete a database record. We’re now going to use it to update a record thanks to the  [submitChanges](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel/methods/submitChanges)  method or remove what we’ve done with the  [resetChanges](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel/methods/resetChanges)  method.
-   [Expression Binding](https://help.sap.com/doc/saphelp_uiaddon10/1.17/en-US/da/f6852a04b44d118963968a1239d2c0/content.htm?no_cache=true): an enhancement of the SAPUI5 binding syntax, which allows for providing expressions instead of custom formatter functions
-   [SimpleForm](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.ui.layout.form.SimpleForm): a layout that allows users to create a pixel-perfect form

So our main task here is to allows the user to edit a Sales Order Item and submit those changes (if made) to the backend system.

Here’s a list of the things you have to do to get to the final result:

-   Add a new column to the table to display the Note value (that’s the field we’re going to update)
-   Make the Product Name active (_titleActive=”true”_) and handle the titlePress event
-   Create a Fragment with inside a  _Dialog_  that contains our  _SimpleForm_
-   The SimpleForm will contain a  _Label_/Input couple for each of our Sales Order Item fields
-   All the Input fields won’t be editable except for the Note one
-   Make the Save button of the dialog enabled only if the Note typed by the user has a length greater than zero
-   Handle the save button submitting all the user changes!
